    Graphs: Collections of Nodes and connections
    VERTEXT = node
    EDGE = connection between nodes
        Good for What?
        - Social networking: Connections between friends
        - Maps
        - the internet: pages that link to each other
        - Recommendations: people also watched, you might like
        No Patterns Just relations to each other
    Types:
        - A tree where a vertex can only have 2 edges max
        - Undirected Graphs: no connection to edges. Basically 2 way connections. Can go from A to B and B to A.
            - FB friend request 2 way relationship.
        - Directed Graphs: Represented with arrows. One way direction.
            - Instagram followers graph. Following someone but not getting followed back.
        - Weighted Graph: when edges have values. Theres info on the connections itself
            - Mapping distance. The edges in miles are weighted. Need to know value
